#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    /*Array is Collection of similar data types stored at
    
    contiguous memory locations

    why array is useful :
        if i want 3 integer or 5 float any more than one similar data type.
        and insted of declaring multiple time we can declare an array /
        we use array because it's accesabilty. it store in a contiguous memory location. 

        e.g. : 
           int  marks1 = 97;
           int  marks2 = 95;
           int  marks3 = 93;

        //    this is a synatax of an array. 
        
           int marks[] = {97,95,93};
    */
    
    return 0;
}
