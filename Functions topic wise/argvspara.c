    -- funtion which can take value or give value.

    function which takes value it's called parameter and return value.
    
    
    passing Arguments:
    
    void printHello();
    
    void printTable(int n)*;
    
    int sum(int a,int b);

    This sum function is taking two parameter a and b. and return value as int show it's written value is int.


    in the function we pass variable which called as a argument like it is always in calling statement and which variable use in function it is known  as knnow as parameter




    Arguments                                |  vs  |          Parameter
1) values that are passed in function call   |      |      1)values in function declaration and defination
2)used to send value                         |      |      2) used to recieve value
3)actual parameter                           |      |      3)formal parameters.
